Given an input string s, reverse the order of the words.
A word is defined as a sequence of non-space characters. The words in s will be separated by at least one space.
Return a string of the words in reverse order concatenated by a single space.
Note that s may contain leading or trailing spaces or multiple spaces between two words. The returned string should only have a single space separating the words. Do not include any extra spaces.

C++:
  class Solution {
  public:
      string reverseWords(string s) {
          stringstream ss(s);
  		    stack<string> tokens;
          string tmp;
          char delimiter = ' ';
          // Splitting the str string by delimiter
          while (getline(ss, tmp, delimiter)) {
  			    if (tmp != "") {
  				    tokens.push(tmp);
  			    }
          }
  		    string result = "";
          while (!tokens.empty()) {
              result += tokens.top() + delimiter;
              tokens.pop();
          }
  		    result.resize(result.length() - 1);
  		    return result;
      }
  };
