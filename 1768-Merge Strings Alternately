https://leetcode.com/problems/merge-strings-alternately/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

You are given two strings word1 and word2.
Merge the strings by adding letters in alternating order, starting with word1.
If a string is longer than the other, append the additional letters onto the end of the merged string.

Space and time complexity of this approach is O(n), where n is the length of the longer string

C++:
  class Solution {
  public:
      string mergeAlternately(string word1, string word2) {
          string result = "";
          int i = 0;
          while (i < word1.length() || i < word2.length()) {
              if (i < word1.length()) {
                  result += word1[i];
              }
              if (i < word2.length()) {
                  result += word2[i];
              }
              i++;
          }
          return result;
      }
  };
