https://leetcode.com/problems/kids-with-the-greatest-number-of-candies/description/?envType=study-plan-v2&envId=leetcode-75

There are n kids with candies.
You are given an integer array candies, where each candies[i] represents the number of candies the ith kid has,
and an integer extraCandies, denoting the number of extra candies that you have.
Return a boolean array result of length n,
where result[i] is true if, after giving the ith kid all the extraCandies, they will have the greatest number of candies among all the kids,
or false otherwise.

C++:
  class Solution {
  public:
      vector<bool> kidsWithCandies(vector<int>& candies, int extraCandies) {
  		vector<bool> result;
  		int max = *max_element(candies.begin(), candies.end());
  		for (int i = 0; i < candies.size(); ++i) {
  			result.push_back(candies[i] + extraCandies >= max);
  		}
  		return result;
      }
  };
